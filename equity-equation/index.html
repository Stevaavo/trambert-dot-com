                    <p>Imagine that you're a mid-level embedded software programmer, and you've been offered a spot as the 5th employee at a small, early-stage startup.  The startup hasn't received series-A funding, but early seed investments have put their valuation at $10 million.  You think that's optimistic, but plausible.  After reviewing your budget, you decide that you need $60k/year to live comfortably, and past that you'd like all your compensation to come in the form of equity.</p>

                    <p>The last thing you need to decide is your "valuation multiplier."  On the one hand, you're an early employee, and embedded programmers are hard to come by.  On the other hand, you're not a senior-level programmer yet, and you don't have experience designing firmware for the kind of hardware that this startup will be manufacturing.  So, you finally decide that adding you to the team will make the company appear roughly 10% more valuable to investors.</p>

                    <p>The Graham Equity Equation doesn't account for the "market rate" of a particular type of employee.  For example, let's say you run a restaurant worth $1mln.  You realize that by hiring a delivery driver, you can raise the value of your restaurant by 30%, due to added revenue from delivery orders.</p>

                    <p>The Equity Equation would tell you that this delivery driver should get an annual salary of $102,000 (assuming you gave him no equity).  In reality, however, $102k is well above the $27k average salary for a delivery driver.  Paying above the market rate probably makes sense for such a key role, but $102k is pretty far out.</p>

Think of it this way: startups only hire new people if they believe that adding them to the team will make the company more valuable. Every new hire brings something to the table - maybe they're a great engineer who will help them build a great product, or a really persuasive marketer who will help them boost sales, or an awesome janitor who will make the office a wonderfully clean place to work.  Their labor is worth something, and the company will be better off for hiring them.</p>

Otherwise, common numbers are 1% or 5%.</p>

                      <p>If the calculator computes a negative number for equity, salary, or company valuation, it's essentially telling you that the company will lose money on this hire.  For example, if the calculator computes a negative number for equity, it's telling you that the employee should not receive any equity, because the salary you specified is already more than this employee deserves.</p>

                      <p>In that case, to justify their hiring, the employee should either take a lower salary, or they need to bring more value to the company (which would be reflected in the equation as a higher valuation multiplier).  You could also try reducing the "salary multiplier" or "company's profit" advanced parameters.</p>

                      <p>Likewise, if the calculator computes a negative number for salary, it's telling you that the employee is already being paid more than they're worth in equity, and they would effectively need to <em>pay money to the company</em> to justify getting that equity.</p>

                      <p>Getting a negative number for the company valuation means something a little different.  It specifically means that the employee is being given too much equity - more than their valuation multiplier could ever justify, no matter how valuable the company is.</p>

            <p>The "salary multiplier" and "company's profit" parameters are important inputs in the equation.  I’m using Paul Graham’s example values by default, but feel free to tweak them.  If you come to regret your tinkering, <a id=resetToDefaultLink href="javascript:void(0);">click here</a> to reset these back to their defaults.</p>

                <td class="bordered leadingTD">
                  <h4>Salary Multiplier <small>(optional)</small></h4>

                  <div id=salaryMultiplierBoxGroup class="input-group">

                  <p>The employee's annual salary is increased by this percentage for the purpose of the equation.  This is because an employee’s salary is paid every year, not just once.  In addition, the company will incur additional “overhead” costs from the new hire.  The salary multiplier accounts for those extra costs.</p>

                  <p>If you set this to zero, the Graham Equation would tell you how much equity/salary an employee should receive in order to leave the company neither any better nor worse-off than they were before they hired him/her.  When you don’t account for profit, the Graham Equation calculates the “break even” number.  No company is interested in merely breaking even on a new hire, so this parameter specifies how much profit they want to make on their new employee.</p>
